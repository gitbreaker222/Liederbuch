TELL ME BABY DON'T YOU SEE?
(THE) FAKE WORLD YOU MADE FOR ME
THE DIRTY SECRETS THAT YOU KEEP
NOW I'M DOING WHAT  FEEL


YOUR LOVE TELLS LIES
YOUR HEART'S LIKE ICE
YOUR LOVE TELLS LIES
YOUR HEART'S LIKE ICE
NO EXCUSES EAT YOUR PRIDE!


CRUEL MAN I KNOW YOUR TRICKS
FOR TOO LONG YOU CUT MY WINGS
NOW I KNOW THE WAY TO LIVE
FUCKING ASSHOLE LET ME BE


YOUR LOVE TELLS LIES
YOUR HEART'S LIKE ICE
YOUR LOVE TELLS LIES
YOUR HEART'S LIKE ICE
NO EXCUSES EAT YOUR PRIDE!


TIME OF TEARS I WAS LOSING MY SOUL
WE HAVE TO LEARN THAT WE WIN AND WE LOSE
THAT EVEN THE HEART ALSO BETRAYS AND IT HURTS

I SAW THE SHINE OF THE LIFE  IN YOUR EYES
I SAW IT BECOME IN DUST AND BLACK LIES
YOUâ€™RE STILL THE SAME BUT I 'M NOT AFRAID ANYMORE
NO MORE


YOUR LOVE TELLS LIES
YOUR HEART'S LIKE ICE
YOUR LOVE TELLS LIES
YOUR HEART'S LIKE ICE
( YOU WON'T DESTROY ME )
( YOU WON'T SINK ME )
YOUR LOVE TELLS LIES
YOUR HEART'S LIKE ICE
( YOU WON'T DESTROY ME )
( YOU WON'T SINK ME )
YOUR LOVE TELLS LIES
YOUR HEART'S LIKE ICE

( YOU WON'T DESTROY ME )
( YOU CAN'T PLAY WITH ME AGAIN )
( YOU WON'T DESTROY ME )

NO LIES ANYMORE
NO TEARS ANYMORE
NO HURT ANYMORE
NO NO
