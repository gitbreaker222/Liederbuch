# Beware

beware of what you say  
beware of what you tell  

what do you see   
if you look around?   
society   
is going down   

and what about me?   
and what about you?   


What do we know?   
What do we think?   
How do they use   
technology?   

and what about me?   
and what about you?   


Don't doubt it   
they want to control   
everything   
welcome to the puppet show   
we all are sheeps   
people want to know   
and you wanna give   
them what they want   

What is the price?   
What is it cost?   
the privacy   
is getting lost?   

and what about me?   
and what about you?   


social media   
is exposing you   
don't you really see   
they trail what you do?
