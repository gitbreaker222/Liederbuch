## Road To Anywhere

We're gonna ride together gonna lose wherever  
burn the wheels until the dawn  
take a road to anywhere  
going after the unknown  

Just go GO GO on the way
playing to knock down the wind  
we will GO for the sun
dying on the horizon  
dying on the horizon yeah  

(chorus)  
shadows of the past  
fading in the dust  
time goes away  

the roar of the engine  
is the soundtrack of our life  
along the path  

this is what we want  
we're partners in crime  
we are again  

on the road  
on the trail


We're gonna ride together  
do the best trip ever  
by the route of the outlaws  
where the wolves seek for a prey  
and the hawks circle above  
just go GO GO never know  
what is gonna be out there  
we will GO anywhere  
we don't need nothing else  
we don't need nothing else yeah

HEY!  
HEY!  
HEY!  

(chorus)  
shadows of the past  
fading in the dust  
time goes away  

the roar of the engine  
is the soundtrack of our life  
along the path  

this is what we want  
we're partners in crime  
we are again  

on the road  
on the trail

HEY!  
HEY!  
HEY!
