## Off the track

You know I don't know, baby  
What the hell went wrong  
It's no easy way out of this turmoil  
Don't know where we're heading  
How to stop the pain  
What to say or do to make it go away  

It's off the track and a long way back  
Just leave it alone  
It's off the track and a long way back  
Move on to the next one  

It's like a long cold winter  
And dark endless nights  
It takes forever to shake it off your mind  
Can't find the ticket out of this place  
Try to run away  
It slaps you in the face  

It's off the track and a long way back  
Just leave it alone  
It's off the track and a long way back  
Move on to the next one  

[Solo]

Going down the same old lane  
There's nothing more to gain  
Keep trying but the weather won't change  
The black cloud behind you  
Bitching up a storm  
No way to get your ass out of this turmoil  
You'll be damned if you do  
You'll be damned if you do  

It's off the track and a long way back  
Just leave it alone  
It's off the track and a long way back  
Move on to the next one
