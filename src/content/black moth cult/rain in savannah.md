## Rain In Savannah

We've all seen deserters  
running to Redwood  
between old shears  
shears of swamp gas  
Looking for redemption  
where cons can't roll  
Riders never wade old-fashioned  
crime  
scenes  

Wine is enough to stay  
wild a king writing a song  
Wine is enough to say:  

Sleepwalking a mile ahead  
Wayland, you're running out of luck  
You're falling down, drawn to the South  

Every color's like blood  
in our black lounge.  
It's pouring down  
like a cascade  
up on the redding scene,  
your eyes will grasp  
Wymore's mother running like a  
crazy  
fuck  

Wine is enough to stay  
wild a king writing a song  
Wine is enough to say:  

Sleepwalking a mile ahead  
Wayland, you're running out of luck  
You're falling down  
drawn to the South  

Look into your eyes...  
See what's on your soul...  
Rain is to dissolve...
