## Redwitch

Electric girl I know you're sorry  
'bout the million burning souls,  
Your scarlet rose's speaking secrets  
on the road to the end of us all.  
And now you're crawling through the briars,  
see if they can follow you all.

Redwitch

Leave trails for them straight to the sun,  
Orchid girls love whispering Moths.  
Evening stars are bleeding on the horizon,  
Goddess shine in new-born devastation.  

Now on your way to this temple  
milking every woman around,  
unmovable oh secret mountain  
for you only way to collide.  
The biggest magnet on this planet's  
right enough to see you're a liar.

Redwitch

Leave trails for them straight to the sun,  
Orchid girls love whispering Moths.  
Evening stars are bleeding on the horizon,  
Goddess shining new-born devastation.
