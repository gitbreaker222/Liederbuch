## Devour The Sun

fountains, untold  
diluvials  
mountains, unseen  
materials  

crunches and turns the axis of time  
an epoch of spring begins  
the wetlands are fructified by  
intoxicating winds  

fathers, mothers  
await the fall  
sisters, brothers  
the end of all  

the fall of man  
the end of all  

weeping, laughter  
everything fades  
whispers, thunder  
vanish in space  

radiant spheres, luminaries  
run out of fuel  
daylight, candles  
all go obscure  

and then the winter no one has seen  
aeons become things of the past  
all die like embers in the northern wind  
frostflowers remain last  

crunches and turns the axis of time  
a beast approaches to devour the sun  
to gorge the barren soul of man  
no more ages to come
