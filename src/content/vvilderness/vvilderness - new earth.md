## New earth

limbo of timelessness  
with shimmering sparks  
swelling as the blind  
clock-maker works  

under a new firmament  
the glow of a final dawn  

as the earth emerges  
from surfs of seas  
a blooming creation  
grass scrubs and trees  
stretch to the sky to seize  
the light  

diversity expands  
in a cambrian explosion  

bushes of foliage  
maintain and hide  
networks of roots  

surround the hive  
of pollinators  
workers of life  

ecosystems of grandeur  
and reckless existence  
committed to endure  
with a great consistence  

earth measures to sky  
low touches the high  
mysteries turn science  
in the steps of giants
