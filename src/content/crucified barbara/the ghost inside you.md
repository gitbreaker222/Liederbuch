## The Ghost Inside You

Once upon a time you had a sun in your mind    
Everybody could see it shine  
It made you glow like a star  
Like a god among the city lights.

Like a queen of rage, you'd spit in the face  
of men who tried to bring you down  
While the good ones found their luck in your attention  

[bridge]  
The unholy ghost is loving your kind  
raping your mind  
It walks right behind you, whispers lies  
to make you go blind  

[chorus]   
Who's the one to blame for all the pain?  
Who thinks he's got the  
right to say that you're not ok?  
The ghost inside .  

Step by step it would break you down  
Everybody could see you fade  
Like a big mistake from the glamorous hights you fell  

You hit the ground with a crash Boom sound  
and everyone looked away  
You're a stranger now that nobody wanna be around  

[bridge]  
The unholy ghost is loving your kind  
raping your mind  
It walks right behind you, whispers lies  
to make you go blind  

[chorus]  
Who's the one to blame for all the pain?  
Who thinks he's got the  
right to say that you're not ok?  
The ghost inside  

Don't believe a word, don't be afraid  
The voice is just a  
fake illusion, born to be astray  
Ghost inside you .  

You gotta bring back the fire  
gotta learn to fly again  
Cut the volume of the voices in your head  

You've gotta tell yourself  
To get back on your feet  
Get back there  
Be the one we desire  

[solo]    

[chorus]  
Who's the one to blame for all the pain?  
Who thinks he's got the  
right to say that you're not ok?  
The ghost inside  

Don't believe a word, don't be afraid  
The voice is just a  
fake illusion, born to be astray  
The ghost inside you .  

Ghost inside you  
The ghost inside you  
The ghost inside you  
Inside of you
