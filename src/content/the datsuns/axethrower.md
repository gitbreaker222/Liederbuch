Something's creeping at your front door  
But you don't understand it oh no more  
Puzzle pieces oh what a trip  
To understand this behemoth monolith

It's alive  
Alive  
It's a live  
Alive  

I notice the gasp in your mouth  
Is beneath calculations to ease your doubt  
I just see television from worlds away  
All the distant workings that we all play  

Time out of mind recollections that we cannot describe  

[solo]

We're all posing as people to get through the day  
We stitch up all the pieces to make us pray for  
Those puzzle pieces yeah what a trip  
To understand this behemoth monolith  

Time out of mind recollections that we cannot describe  

It's alive  
Alive  
It's a live  
Alive
