## Gods Are Bored

Pictures of chaos fill our screens day and night  
Is this sensational or is it merely playtime?  
We're going down down down down at their choosing  
Among the heartache, the tears and the bruises  

You know the gods, yeah the gods are so bored  
We entertain with our lives and our flaws  
You know the gods, yeah the gods are so bored  
Come get wild tonight  

Holy rollers, hypocrites knock on the door  
Microscopic, tectonic war  
We're going down down down down at their choosing  
Among the heartache, the tears and the bruises  

You know the gods, yeah the gods are so bored  
We entertain with our lives and our flaws  
You know the gods, yeah the gods are so bored  
Come now die hey hey hey hey tonight  

You know the gods, yeah the gods are so bored  
We entertain with our lives and our flaws  
You know the gods, yeah the gods are so bored  
Come now why hey hey hey hey tonight
