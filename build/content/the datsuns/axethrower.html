<p>Something&#39;s creeping at your front door<br>But you don&#39;t understand it oh no more<br>Puzzle pieces oh what a trip<br>To understand this behemoth monolith</p>
<p>It&#39;s alive<br>Alive<br>It&#39;s a live<br>Alive  </p>
<p>I notice the gasp in your mouth<br>Is beneath calculations to ease your doubt<br>I just see television from worlds away<br>All the distant workings that we all play  </p>
<p>Time out of mind recollections that we cannot describe  </p>
<p>[solo]</p>
<p>We&#39;re all posing as people to get through the day<br>We stitch up all the pieces to make us pray for<br>Those puzzle pieces yeah what a trip<br>To understand this behemoth monolith  </p>
<p>Time out of mind recollections that we cannot describe  </p>
<p>It&#39;s alive<br>Alive<br>It&#39;s a live<br>Alive</p>
