<h2 id="rain-in-savannah">Rain In Savannah</h2>
<p>We&#39;ve all seen deserters<br>running to Redwood<br>between old shears<br>shears of swamp gas<br>Looking for redemption<br>where cons can&#39;t roll<br>Riders never wade old-fashioned<br>crime<br>scenes  </p>
<p>Wine is enough to stay<br>wild a king writing a song<br>Wine is enough to say:  </p>
<p>Sleepwalking a mile ahead<br>Wayland, you&#39;re running out of luck<br>You&#39;re falling down, drawn to the South  </p>
<p>Every color&#39;s like blood<br>in our black lounge.<br>It&#39;s pouring down<br>like a cascade<br>up on the redding scene,<br>your eyes will grasp<br>Wymore&#39;s mother running like a<br>crazy<br>fuck  </p>
<p>Wine is enough to stay<br>wild a king writing a song<br>Wine is enough to say:  </p>
<p>Sleepwalking a mile ahead<br>Wayland, you&#39;re running out of luck<br>You&#39;re falling down<br>drawn to the South  </p>
<p>Look into your eyes...<br>See what&#39;s on your soul...<br>Rain is to dissolve...  </p>
<p>Rain in Savannah<br>Rain in Savannah<br>Rain in Savannah<br>Rain in Savannah<br>Rain in Savannah<br>Rain in Savannah<br>Rain in Savannah<br>Rain in Savannah<br>Rain in Savannah<br>Rain in Savannah<br>Rain in Savannahs  </p>
