<h2 id="off-the-track">Off the track</h2>
<p>You know I don&#39;t know, baby<br>What the hell went wrong<br>It&#39;s no easy way out of this turmoil<br>Don&#39;t know where we&#39;re heading<br>How to stop the pain<br>What to say or do to make it go away  </p>
<p>It&#39;s off the track and a long way back<br>Just leave it alone<br>It&#39;s off the track and a long way back<br>Move on to the next one  </p>
<p>It&#39;s like a long cold winter<br>And dark endless nights<br>It takes forever to shake it off your mind<br>Can&#39;t find the ticket out of this place<br>Try to run away<br>It slaps you in the face  </p>
<p>It&#39;s off the track and a long way back<br>Just leave it alone<br>It&#39;s off the track and a long way back<br>Move on to the next one  </p>
<p>[Solo]</p>
<p>Going down the same old lane<br>There&#39;s nothing more to gain<br>Keep trying but the weather won&#39;t change<br>The black cloud behind you<br>Bitching up a storm<br>No way to get your ass out of this turmoil<br>You&#39;ll be damned if you do<br>You&#39;ll be damned if you do  </p>
<p>It&#39;s off the track and a long way back<br>Just leave it alone<br>It&#39;s off the track and a long way back<br>Move on to the next one  </p>
