<h2 id="the-ghost-inside-you">The Ghost Inside You</h2>
<p>Once upon a time you had a sun in your mind<br>Everybody could see it shine<br>It made you glow like a star<br>Like a god among the city lights.</p>
<p>Like a queen of rage, you&#39;d spit in the face<br>of men who tried to bring you down<br>While the good ones found their luck in your attention  </p>
<p>[bridge]<br>The unholy ghost is loving your kind<br>raping your mind<br>It walks right behind you, whispers lies<br>to make you go blind  </p>
<p>[chorus]<br>Who&#39;s the one to blame for all the pain?<br>Who thinks he&#39;s got the<br>right to say that you&#39;re not ok?<br>The ghost inside .  </p>
<p>Step by step it would break you down<br>Everybody could see you fade<br>Like a big mistake from the glamorous hights you fell  </p>
<p>You hit the ground with a crash Boom sound<br>and everyone looked away<br>You&#39;re a stranger now that nobody wanna be around  </p>
<p>[bridge]<br>The unholy ghost is loving your kind<br>raping your mind<br>It walks right behind you, whispers lies<br>to make you go blind  </p>
<p>[chorus]<br>Who&#39;s the one to blame for all the pain?<br>Who thinks he&#39;s got the<br>right to say that you&#39;re not ok?<br>The ghost inside  </p>
<p>Don&#39;t believe a word, don&#39;t be afraid<br>The voice is just a<br>fake illusion, born to be astray<br>Ghost inside you .  </p>
<p>You gotta bring back the fire<br>gotta learn to fly again<br>Cut the volume of the voices in your head  </p>
<p>You&#39;ve gotta tell yourself<br>To get back on your feet<br>Get back there<br>Be the one we desire  </p>
<p>[solo]    </p>
<p>[chorus]<br>Who&#39;s the one to blame for all the pain?<br>Who thinks he&#39;s got the<br>right to say that you&#39;re not ok?<br>The ghost inside  </p>
<p>Don&#39;t believe a word, don&#39;t be afraid<br>The voice is just a<br>fake illusion, born to be astray<br>The ghost inside you .  </p>
<p>Ghost inside you<br>The ghost inside you<br>The ghost inside you<br>Inside of you  </p>
